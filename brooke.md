Key Principles of CSS:
1. Declaration block:
  ## Write two examples, one each way
2. Box Model
3. Cascading Stylesheet:
  - Order: Browser default, external stylesheet, internal stylesheet, inline styling

Best Practices:

Chrome Dev Tools:
- Target a selector, change what you want to test/edit on the fly
- When you refresh, changes will be lost
- Can target/look at pseudo classes

How To Link To External Stylesheet:
- <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/1.11.8/semantic.min.css"/>
- Semantic: minimizes the amount of time you need to spend styling by providing defaults for cards, nav bars, menus, dividers. Also includes it's own version of grid which is split into 16 rows and helps you divide your page (show example of grid in the code)
- Helps ensure that design is responsive
- Google Fonts: linking in external fonts, makes sure that fonts are accessible to all browsers that allow (but also smart to provide a backup). Makes sites look doper, easy!

Custom:
- FLEX BOX: whenever i'm writing my own css i have it open. super easy way to divide blocks of code and organize them in relation to one another.

Bonus:
- Dope websites have Favicons and animated gradients
