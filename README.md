### Key Principles of CSS
```css
  ul.my-things > li {
    color: black;
  }

  p {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
```
* Creating a declaration block
  * `p`: selector (selectors are used to select the HTML elements that you want to style)
  * `ul.my-things > li`: uses a child combinator to target specific elements on the page
    * Elements that match the second selector that are also immediate children of the first selector
  * `font-weight`: attribute or property name
  * `bolder`: value
* The Box Model
  * Padding: distance from the inside of the `div` to the border
  * Border: border around `div`
  * Margin: distance from exterior content to the `div`
* Cascading Stylesheet
  * Cascading: Cascading means that styles can cascade from one stylesheet to another, meaning that we can use multiple stylesheets at a time
  * The files are read from most general to most specific, so the most specific styles will be the ones that ultimately appear on the page
  * Three ways to write css in relation to an HTML document:
    * In-line styling: ```<p style="color: red">in line!</p>```
    * Internal stylesheet: ```<head> <style> p {color: red;}</style> </head>```
    * External stylesheet: ```<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./style.css"/>```
  * Style is inherited if not explicitly defined
  * Will always look to nearest definition, if style is declared multiple times.

### Best Practices
* Use `class` over `id` when adding selectors to HTML tags
* BEM (Block Element Modifier)
  * Block: `header`, `container`, `menu`, `checkbox`, `input`
  * Element: list item, checkbox caption, header title
  * Modifier: `disabled`, `highlighted`, `checked`, fixed, size big, color yellow

### Chrome Dev Tools
* Can test/edit CSS in real time in the Chrome browser
* Pseudo-classes: used to define special states of an element, where applicable
  * `a:hover` (targets a link when hovered over)
  * `a:active` (targets a link when active, used in nav bars )
  * `div:first-child` (targets the first nested child inside of a `div` )
  * `input:optional` (makes an `input` within a `form` optional)
  * `p::after` (inserts content after every `p` tag)

### Bringing in external resources
* Semantic UI, Material UI, Bootstrap - CSS Frameworks that provide easy ways to style content
* Google Fonts - Library of fonts that can be imported to enhance style of markup

### Flexbox and writing custom CSS
* Flexbox: direction agnostic layout that helps to organize `divs` on an HTML page
* ```div {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}```
